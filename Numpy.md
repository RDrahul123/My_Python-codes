# üìä NumPy - Comprehensive Guide

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source library for numerical computing in Python. It provides an efficient interface for handling large multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions for operations on these data structures. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and engineering applications.

## üìö Core Concepts in NumPy

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Understanding NumPy Arrays**
NumPy arrays, or `ndarray` objects, are the central feature of NumPy. They allow efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets. Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays provide faster computations and require less memory due to their fixed data type.

#### üìå Why Use NumPy Arrays Over Lists?
- **Performance:** NumPy arrays are significantly faster than Python lists because they are implemented in C and use contiguous memory storage.
- **Memory Efficiency:** NumPy arrays require less memory than equivalent Python lists because they store homogeneous data types.
- **Convenience:** NumPy provides built-in functions for efficient mathematical operations.
- **Broadcasting:** Allows arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes without explicit loops.

#### ‚úÖ Creating NumPy Arrays
NumPy arrays can be created from Python lists or tuples using `np.array()`:

```python
import numpy as np

# 1D Array
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

# 2D Array
arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], 
                 [4, 5, 6]])

# 3D Array
arr3 = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], 
                 [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Understanding Array Attributes**
NumPy arrays have various attributes that provide insights into their structure and properties:

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print(arr.shape)   # (2, 3) -> Shape of the array
print(arr.ndim)    # 2 -> Number of dimensions
print(arr.dtype)   # int64 -> Data type of elements
print(arr.size)    # 6 -> Total number of elements
print(arr.itemsize) # Size of each element in bytes
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Indexing and Slicing in NumPy**
NumPy allows easy access and modification of array elements using indexing and slicing.

#### üìå **Accessing Elements in a 1D Array**
```python
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
print(arr[1])         # Output: 20 (Access element at index 1)
print(arr[-1])        # Output: 50 (Last element)
```

#### üìå **Slicing Arrays**
```python
print(arr[1:4])       # Output: [20 30 40] (Elements from index 1 to 3)
print(arr[::-1])      # Output: [50 40 30 20 10] (Reverse the array)
```

#### üìå **Indexing in Multidimensional Arrays**
```python
arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(arr2d[0, 1])   # Output: 2 (Element at row 0, column 1)
print(arr2d[:, 1])   # Output: [2 5] (All rows, Column 1)
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Broadcasting in NumPy**
Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes.

```python
A = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])  # Shape (3,1)
B = np.array([4, 5, 6])        # Shape (1,3)

result = A + B  # Broadcasting occurs
print(result)
```

**How Broadcasting Works:**
1. Smaller array is expanded to match the larger array's shape.
2. Operations are performed element-wise without explicit loops.
3. Saves memory and improves performance.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Mathematical Operations on NumPy Arrays**
NumPy provides vectorized operations that are optimized for performance.

```python
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print(arr1 + arr2)   # Output: [5 7 9] (Element-wise addition)
print(arr1 * arr2)   # Output: [4 10 18] (Element-wise multiplication)
print(np.sin(arr1))  # Applies sine function element-wise
print(np.exp(arr1))  # Applies exponential function element-wise
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Reshaping and Flattening Arrays**
You can change the shape of an array without changing its data.

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])

print(arr.reshape(2, 3))   # Reshape into 2x3 matrix
print(arr.flatten())       # Output: [1 2 3 4 5 6] (Flatten into 1D array)
```
